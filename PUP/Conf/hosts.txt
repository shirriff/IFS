# hosts.txt:
#
# This is similar in nearly every way to a typical UNIX 'hosts' file except that
# Xerox Inter-Network Name Expressions (i.e. network#host#) are used instead of IP addresses.
#
# Format for Inter-Network name expressions is either:
#  network#host#  (to specify hosts on another network)
#    or
#  host#          (to specify hosts on the same network as this IFS server)
#
#  all numbers are in octal.
