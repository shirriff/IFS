    /// Implements the logic for encapsulating a 3mbit ethernet packet into/out of UDP datagrams.
    /// Sent packets are broadcast to the subnet. 
    /// 
    /// A brief diversion into the subject of broadcasts and the reason for using them.  (This applies
    /// to the Ethernet transport as well.)
    /// 
    /// Effectively, the IFS suite is implemented on top of a virtual 3 Megabit Ethernet network
    /// encapsulated over a modern network (UDP over IP, raw Ethernet frames, etc.).  Participants
    /// on this virtual network are virtual Altos (ContrAlto or others) and real Altos bridged via
    /// a 3M<->100M device.
    /// 
    /// Any of these virtual or real Altos can, at any time, be running in Promiscuous mode, can send
    /// arbitrary packets with any source or destination address in the header, or send broadcasts.  
    /// This makes address translation from the virtual (3M) side to the physical (UDP, 100M) side and 
    /// back again tricky.  It also makes it tricky to ensure an outgoing packet makes it to any and 
    /// all parties that may be interested (consider the Promiscuous Alto case.)
    /// 
    /// If each participant on the virtual network were to have a table mapping physical (UDP IP, 100M MAC) to
    /// virtual (3M MAC) addresses then broadcasts could be avoided, but it complicates the logic in all
    /// parties and requires each user to maintain this mapping table manually.
    /// 
    /// Resorting to using broadcasts at all times on the physical network removes these complications and
    /// makes it easy for end-users to deal with.
    /// The drawback is that broadcasts can reduce the efficiency of the network segment they're broadcast to.
    /// However, most Alto networks are extremely quiet (by today's standards) -- the maximum throughput
    /// of one Alto continuously transferring data to another is on the order of 20-30 kilobytes/sec.  
    /// (Most of the time, a given Alto will be completely silent.)
    /// On a modern 100M or 1G network, this is background noise and modern computers receiving these broadcasts
    /// will hardly notice.
    /// 
    /// Based on the above, and after a lot of experimentation, it was decided to err on the side of simplicity 
    /// and go with the broadcast implementation.
